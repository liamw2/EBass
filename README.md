PWM Tone App
============

Play tones (hopefully musical notes) via the speaker on the Microbit. Uses PWM
to create the tone.

Have each fret position mark a major chord, instead of EADG

Demonstrate that the work you're putting in is enough, seems very simple
- LED matrix with given note?

Superposition for the four notes on one speaker output, would add more complexity
-  Sine function to generate amplitude
-  Amplitude --> PWM width directly
-  Similar to the record and play lab
